# Osmosis Frontend 👩‍🔬⚗️🧪

![osmosis-banner-1200w](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4606373/167008669-fb3cafa8-e66e-4cdf-8599-3308039cc58c.png)

## Overview 💻

Our [frontend](https://app.osmosis.zone) is built with the following tools:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): type checking
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): ui
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): styling, theming
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): scaffolding/SSR/CDN/SEO
  - We deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/solutions/nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=next-website) for optimizations out of the box, behind [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
- [Turbo Repo](https://turbo.build/repo): mono repo management with package script execution, with heavy emphasis on build caching (including shared remote caching in Vercel)
- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/): libs release

## Deployment 🚀

Install deps:

```bash
yarn
```

Start web server

```bash
yarn start
```

## Contributing 👨‍💻

We welcome and encourage contributions! We recommend looking for [issues labeled with "good-first-issue"](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-frontend/contribute).

Make sure [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16 and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) is installed.

1. Install deps

```bash
yarn
```

**First time setup** If you're on the Osmosis foundation team and have a Vercel account set up, optionally sign into turbo repo using your Vercel account, and link the repo. This could give you instant builds by sharing the remote cache on our Vercel project:

```bash
npx turbo login
...login via browser...
npx turbo link
...press y (yes) and choose "OsmoLabs" as the Vercel build scope...
```

2.  Run local server at [`localhost:3000`](localhost:3000)

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Frontier 🤠

To reduce duplicated effort, `master` branch is used to deploy the frontier app as well. The frontier deployment has `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_FRONTIER` env var set to `true`. If making
updates to frontier, please target the master branch. Frontier assets are configured in `packages/web/config/ibc-assets.ts`.

### Develop

To develop with frontier configuration, use:

```bash
yarn build:frontier && yarn dev:frontier
```

### Deploy

To deploy frontier (the env var will be set for you):

```bash
yarn build:frontier && yarn start:frontier
```

Otherwise the non-frontier commands can be used with the env var set to true.

### Testnet

Testnet version of the frontend uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_IS_TESTNET=true`. By default, it points to the canonical testnet, but packages/web/.env can be changed to point to [localosmosis](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis/tree/main/tests/localosmosis).

Dev:

```bash
yarn build:testnet && yarn dev:testnet
```

Deploy:

```bash
yarn build:testnet && yarn start:testnet
```

Note: our currency registrar checks IBC hashes to see if they can be found via the denom_trace query in the IBC module on chain. If it's not found, it won't add it to the chain's list of currencies. Make sure IBC assets on testnet can be found in the testnet's IBC module state for test IBC assets to be visible. Otherwise, test assets (i.e. made via tokenfactory) can be added as native assets to the Osmosis chain, simply by defining it's base denom in the Osmosis chain info for testnet.

## Releases

Release tags are for the published [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/org/osmosis-labs), which are every package except for the web package. Updates to the app are released incrementally way via deployments from master branch.

To start the release process:

```bash
yarn build:libs && npx lerna publish
```

## Localization 🌎🗺

Have a change you want to make with our translations? We have a frontend for updating localizations in our app easily, all you need is a GitHub account. Coming soon: creating new language profiles from this frontend.
