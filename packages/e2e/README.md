### Synthetic Geo Monitoring Frontend tests

Monitoring tests are using `osmo1dkmsds5j6q9l9lv4dkhas68767tlqfx8ls5j0c` and `osmo1fapvfx64af2eperkggnwd6zmpzdvvnq4xjc2dv` wallets for a different regions.
In CI secrets they are referenced as:
TEST_PRIVATE_KEY_1 for `osmo1dkmsds5j6q9l9lv4dkhas68767tlqfx8ls5j0c`
TEST_PRIVATE_KEY_2 for `osmo1fapvfx64af2eperkggnwd6zmpzdvvnq4xjc2dv`

Each monitoring test wallet must contain following tokens:

- OSMO > 10
- USDC > 10
- USDT > 2
- USDC.eth.axl > 2

The USDC is used to buy OSMO and WBTC and must be kept above 5$ at all times, so it is better to have some buffer.
