        Osmosis is a decentralized peer-to-peer blockchain that people can use
        to create liquidity and trade IBC enabled tokens. The Osmosis blockchain
        is made up of free, public, and open-source software. Your use of
        Osmosis involves various risks, including, but not limited, to losses
        while digital assets are being supplied to Osmosis pools and losses due
        to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a trading pair or liquidity
        pool, including Impermanent Loss. Before using any pool on the Osmosis
        blockchain, you should review the relevant documentation to make sure
        you understand how Osmosis works, and the pool you use on Osmosis works.
        Additionally, just as you can access email protocols, such as SMTP,
        through multiple email clients, you can access pools on Osmosis through
        several web or mobile interfaces. You are responsible for doing your own
        diligence on those interfaces to understand the fees and risks they
        present.
        <br />
        <br />
        AS DESCRIBED IN THE OSMOSIS LICENSES, THE OSMOSIS PROTOCOL IS PROVIDED
        “AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. Although
        Osmosis Labs Pte. Ltd. ( “Osmosis Labs” ) developed much of the initial
        code for the Osmosis protocol, it does not provide, own, or control the
        Osmosis protocol, which is run by a decentralized validator set.
        Upgrades and modifications to the protocol are managed in a
        community-driven way by holders of the OSMO governance token. No
        developer or entity involved in creating the Osmosis protocol will be
        liable for any claims or damages whatsoever associated with your use,
        inability to use, or your interaction with other users of the Osmosis
        protocol, including any direct, indirect, incidental, special,
        exemplary, punitive or consequential damages, or loss of profits,
        cryptocurrencies, tokens, or anything else of value.

        On June 7, 2022, a software bug related to Osmosis liquidity pool led to
        an incorrect, excessive amount of LP shares to be distributed. While
        under no obligation to do so, Osmosis Foundation has decided to take
        certain steps to compensate those affected by the exploit. On June 28,
        2022, Osmosis will distribute tokens in-kind to losses to affected
        wallet addresses. Liquidity providers of affected pools will receive
        tokens (or OSMO for non-liquid assets) sent to their account equivalent
        to the amount affected by the bug. In consideration for this payment,
        you agree to waive, release, covenant not to sue and forever discharge
        Osmosis Foundation Ltd., its vendors, affiliates and licensees, and
        their respective owners, corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates,
        licensees and the officers, shareholders, directors, employees, agents,
        representatives, successors and assigns of each of these (collectively,
        “Releasees”) from any and all claims, demands, causes of action,
        liabilities, losses, injuries, damages, costs, and expenses (including,
        without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees) whatsoever that relate
        to, arise out of, or are in any way connected to (i) the loss of funds,
        or (ii) the services provided to you by the Releases, whether or not any
        such Claims may be based on or arise out of the negligent acts or
        omissions of any of the Releasees or otherwise. If you do not accept the
        terms outlined above and/or do not wish to accept the distributed funds,
        please contact inquiry@osmosis.team and an Osmosis team member will help
        you return the funds.
